0 triviapoints tps~
Trivia points are like exp or qp in that they allow
you to exchange them in order to acquire something
far greater.  There are only a few ways to gain
these precious flakes, but they are well worth it.
One way is to succesfully answer trivia questions,
or to go on an imm run quest.  It may even be
possible to get them through being mindful of RP, 
though there are no promises.  The best way so far
to gain the flakes is in the sweet art of removing
someone's head from their shoulders.  

Something things TP may* allow you to purchase:

The one time ability to restore - 2 tp on another
                                  1 tp on yourself
Immunities to certain abilities - 5 tp each immune
   ** remember all immunities were taken out of train,
      you will not be able to gain weapon immunities
      through here, only spells like charm, sleep, etc
Golem being able to gen1 in another class - 17 tp
Having the affects of the Visor of Vision - 4 tp 
                                            1 hour
Drow being able to buy extra sub-classes - 10 tp
Jedi and Amazon combo speed up - 2 tp per point
Random command ability - 7 tp
Rigged armor - depends on what you ask for up to imm
Buy an artifact - 10 tp
Claim an artifact - 30 tp
Able to train 250 above your max stat - 7 tp can be
                                        used 10 times

More abilities on the way as we come up with them.  You
could probably ask for what ya want when you come to turn
in the flakes.  Just keep in mind if you give a rediculous
request the imm might possibly give you a rediculous answer.

Oh, and eat flakes as soon as you get them or someone will
end up stealing it.

*Buying of these abilities is solely up to the imm
 you're buying from.  If an imm rules one way don't
 go to another trying to reverse their judgement.
~

0 gamble gambling~
Gambling is a new and entertaining way to spend 
and possibly double your hard earned quest points.
Anyone can start a game of blackjack, but you can
only be in one game at a time.  To start your own
game you type gamble start (name of the game) (tick)
so for example you'd type gamble start joinme 5
Doing this would start a game with the name joinme
and keep it open for joining for 5 ticks.  If you 
wish to join this game you type gamble join joinme
and wait for the dealer to deal his card.  When he 
does you decide how much you'd like to play for.  To
play you gamble bid (amount) Amount being the amount
of quest points you're willing to gamble with.  The
range is 0 - 300, bid at your own risk.  During the 
game you are able to hit or stand by typing gamble
hit or gamble stand.  Its up to you whether you hit
or stand, The dealer will only stand on a 17 or above,
just so you know. If you tie the dealer, you don't
lose, and you don't gain.
~

0 TRIVIA~
Imms will randomly ask questions and give qp to 
the person who correctly answers their question.
To answer the question simply use the answer 
command, by typing answer then the answer to
the question.  Using any other channel will
usually not get you the win, but is up to the
imm running the trivia.  Rewards are also up
to the imm and the length of the trivia session.
Spamming answers usually results in the imm 
ignoring you and whining does too.

Help tps for an explination of trivia points, and
what they can do for you.
~

0 CHALLENGE GENSPAR~
To challenge a player for now you must write a
note to imm stating you'd like to challenge
the person holding the generation you'd like.

Rules for the Challenger:

If you lose you must pay the victor 500 qp.  You
also can not challenge again for another 3 weeks.  
If the challenged shows up and you don't you lose
1k qp instead and still have to wait another 3
weeks to challenge.

Rules for the Challenged:

If you lose you simply lose you gen and gain the 
gen of the player you lost to.  If that player
was gen2 you control their clan no chance to 
change the name.  

Rules for Both:

If neither of you can make it or need to reschedule
be sure to give atleast one days notice.  Some
exceptions will be given.  If neither show up with
no notice and no good excuse both will lose their
gen with a 1 week waiting period from the time of
the missed date.
~

0 COLOR~
To add color, use the following guide before the text that you want colored.

For example: ‘&&RI &&Gwuv &&Mcolor&&w.’ will look like:
		‘&RI &Gwuv &Mcolor&w.’

Color Code List

&&R for &RRed&w
&&B for &BBlue&w
&&C for &CCyan&w
&&M for &MMagenta&w
&&Y for &YYellow&w
&&G for &GGreen&w
&&W for &WWhite&w

You can also make a darker version of each color using a lowercase letter instead.

For example: &&r becomes &rDark Red&w.

Putting a &&* will set a random color.

At the end of your color schemes, put a &&x.  This will reset the color after your text to the default.
~

0 tier~
Tiers are a new way to keep the mud fun.
To work towards your tier you type tier train, after
that you will no longer gain exp instead every 100k
of exp you would normally gain from a mob goes towards
your tier.  Typing tier all by itself shows you how
many Tier x's you currently have.  Once you reach
50 Tier x's and have the required stats you may
tier raise.  Upon tier raising you are known as tier2.
The first thing you'll notice is your stats go down
depending on what they were when you raised.  
On the bright side you'll take a lot less damage 
and gain extra attacks.  Another perk is your stat
cap will now be 30k instead of the 25k restriction
placed on tier1.  Also you'll be able to use the
commands glorify and set.
~

0 GLORIFY~
By glorifying an Immortal you gain their favor.  In doing so they grant you 
extra abilities.  Each immortal gives you a different ability.  Some of 
the glorifies have disadvantages along with their advantages.  Others have 
only advantages.  There are six Immortals who you can glorify.

Smoo
   Advantage - Increases the amount of damage each of your hits do.
   Disadvantage - Lowers the amount of times you actually hit.

Jeremy
   Advantage - Gives you extra normal attacks in battle.
   Disadvantage - Takes away your tier damage reducer.

Geonn
   Advantage - Increases the amount of damage your in-between round 
               attacks do.  (i.e. circle, backstab, claws, spells, etc.)
   Disadvantage - Lowers the amount of damage your normal attacks do.  
                  (i.e. slash, slice, unarmed, etc.)

Myzery
   Advantage - Doubles the rate at which you regenerate your hp, mana 
               and moves.
   Disadvantage - None

Tanais
   Advantage - Allows you to grow a piece of fluff each tick. You can 
               grow up to 7 pieces of fluff in total. Each time you 
               get hit, it takes away one piece of fluff and divides 
               the damage done to you by the amount of fluff you have.
   Disadvantage - None

Unsung Hero
   Advantage - Absorbs a large amount of damage..
   Disadvantage - None

It is free to glorify an Immortal, however it will cost you 300 qps
to lose their favor. The command to stop glorifying an Immortal is 
'glorify clear'.

0 mirkwood~
Written by Yaegar using MZF and a DOS text Editor in December 1995. Based
loosely on the forest mentioned in the works of Tolkien of the same name.

Thanks to J.R.R. Tolkien and the gang at AM.

0 golem rock~
Golems the class of enchanted formations that can melt and solidify 
themselves at will.  Golems change their shape using the command solid 
with which they can solidify into ruby form, gold form, or granite 
form.  Golems equipment comes from chunk of granite stone which lie 
around the mud.  When a golem finds a piece they then bend that piece 
of granite into a piece of armor.

* Rocktalk  -Golems channel for chatting.
* Harden    -Golems way to learn new abilities.
	    -Golems can harden symantics, tacticals, and magitos.
* Texturize -Ankhs and Rok can use this command to make new golems.
* Modify    -Ankhs and Rok can use this command to put golems in their 
	     respective clans.
* Bend      -Golems ability to make equipment.

Once you become a golem, you will be clinically disabled from becoming a
generation one of any other class. You will automatically be stricken of
the generation one if you are another class and earn it.

See also golemforms for help on golem forms and combos.
~
0 golemforms golemcombos~
Golem forms are achieved in two ways.

1. The solidify command
   Ruby, Gold, and Granite are achieved through here

   Solid ruby
        instantly turns you in to ruby and aids you in regeneration.
   Solid Gold
        Turns you in to a bomb of gold, when you go off you burst
        in to the room and all the rooms around you damaging the
        monsters with golden splints.
   Granite
        Not a true form, however solid granite project will place you
        in to astral projection, where you will find your own personal
        portal chamber...You can create portals to rooms by first going
        to that room and typing solid granite create (portal name)..
        You can have infinate portals. They can also be deleted through
        solid granite delete (portal name)

2. Combos
  Some forms are completed through a combonation of moves in combat. These
are:
    Crystal
        Elbow, Groin, Bazma
        -Takes away practically 99% of the damage done to you, while disabling
         your ability to deal damage.
        -If you have Enhanced Crystal (It's automatic in Crystal form, if you
         have the power) then moves take half the time while in crystal form.

    Emerald
        Sumo, Bazma, Sumo
        -Makes you take a LOT more damage each round. Once you get mortally
         wounded, you regenerate a highly random amount of hp, the number
         can be up to your maximum..this costs 5000 movement points and can
         be VERY hard to pull off. (You need proper timing)..
        -Golems that don't know how to use this WILL die frequently, because
         you do not deal enough damage in one lifetime to kill an equal..

    Obsidian
        Backsl, Elbow, Sumo, Bazma, Neckcrack, Neckcrack
        -Pure offense, makes you take slightly more damage while making you
         hit extremely hard.

  When you are in a form, and you try to change to another form, you have an
  instantanious chemical reaction, placing you in the new one immediately as
  oppose to going through transition stages. This can be used for instant gold
  bombs through solid ruby and then solid gold, among other bits of skill you
  will have to pick up on your own.

0 'deathtrap dungeon'~
Deathtrap Dungeon is the second area i have written based on the works of
Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone, the first being The Warlock of Firetop
Mountain. This area is significantly harder, though I trust it will prove
to be as equally exciting and challenging to players as my first attempt
proved to be.

0 WEREWOLF WEREWOLVES~
At the beginning of things, Gaia - the world and the spirit that embodies 
it - set all things in a balance that would maintain and encourage life.  
Near the top of this chain of being was humanity, and above them were the 
Garou - the sacred warriors of the spirit.  They were appointed to be the 
crusaders against the Wyrm, who spreads its cancer through the humans.  
They are the preservers of the raw essence of life, of nature's diversity 
and purity.  They are the Earth's immune system, fighting the disease of 
the Wyrm.  They are the werewolves, and they fight and destroy the 
children of the Wyrm (such as the vampires) at every opportunity.

0 VOODOO~
Syntax: Spell:   cast voodoo <victim>
        Ability: voodoo <victim> <action>

Voodoo magic allows the caster to do things to another player indirectly.
First, a body part of the victim is needed.  The caster should hold this 
part and cast the spell on the target (they don't have to be in the same 
room).  This will create the voodoo doll, which the caster the voodoo 
commands on to interfere with the victim.
There are three voodoo actions.  The first, 'Stab', is only of use as a 
warning to the victim, or to cause annoyance.  The second, 'Throw', will 
hurl the victim from their feet and cause a small amount of damage.  The 
third and final action, 'Burn', will set the victim on fire, as well as

~

0 VAMPIRE VAMPIRES~
Vampires are the creatures of the night and thus take damage if exposed to
daylight.  Vampires cannot eat food, or drink any liquids except for blood.
If they cannot drink blood for a long duration of time they will start taking 
damage or maybe even go berserk, so it's a good idea to store some blood in
a drinking container.  Vampires take half damage from cold, none from gas,
and double from fire, although those with the Heat immunity take normal fire
damage rather than double.

Vampires use the power of their blood, known as #1DISCIPLINES#n and the
potency of their blood to fight enemies.  A vampires generation is a symbol
of how far from the first Vampire, Cain, he is.  The lower the generation
the larger blood pool and the harder to destroy (higher parry/dodge) a
vampire is.  The most powerful are those of the Methuselah Founders.
Training AGE is very important to a vampires power.

A vampires existance is in constant struggle with the #1BEAST#n. There
are those who leash the beast and have reached #1GOLCONDA#n, a great sense
of peace.  However others release the #1BEAST#n and become vampires of
pure destruction, ready to destroy the country side.  Yet a vampire can
appease his beast with a ritual of #1BEASTDOWN#n, lowering the beast at
the cost of the energy the vampire has gained. To those fortunate golconda
vampires they are able to act the right of #1DAYWALKER#n and become
invulnerable to sun damage

The VAMPALLOW command toggles on/off whether vampires may bite/feed you.

~

0 'VALLEY ELF'~
Valley elves are as tall as most humans.  They are thin and have sharp and
pointed features.  They are reclusive and resent intrusion.  All other sorts
of elves, including the drow, shun valley elves.  The latter, in turn, dislike
association with any races save perhaps gnomekind, whom they tolerate.

0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.
~

8 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

0 TRANSPORT~
Syntax: cast transport <object> <character>

0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <str/int/wis/dex/con>
Syntax: train <avatar/mortal/primal/hp/mana/move>
Syntax: train <slash/stab/smash/beast/grab>
Syntax: train <charm/heat/cold/lightning/acid/sleep/drain/voodoo>
Syntax: train <hurl/backstab/kick/steal/disarm>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class.  You can increase 
your attributes by spending experience points (exp) at a trainer.

It costs 200 exp to train a stat (str, int, etc), except that it costs 
only 100 exp to train your primary stat.  Primal costs 500 exp for the 
first point, 1000 for the second, 1500 for the third, etc, and 
hp/mana/move cost your current amount in that particular area minus your 
con (for hp and move) or wis (for mana) per point.  Becoming a mortal or 
an avatar costs 1000 exp each.

You can also train weapon resistances (reduces between 1 and all of the 
damage per blow for that weapon type), spell immunities (those types 
of spell do no damage to you), and skill immunities (they no long have 
any affect on you).  These cost 10000 exp for the first, 20000 for the 
second, 30000 for the third, and so on.
~

0 TIE UNTIE GAG BLINDFOLD~
Syntax: tie <target>
Syntax: untie <target>
Syntax: gag <target>
Syntax: blindfold <target>

TIE allows you yo tie up another player, who must be stunned, 
incapitated, or mortally wounded.  While tied up, a players actions are 
limited - they cannot move, quit, or do many other commands.

UNTIE will untie a player who is currently tied up.  A player cannot 
untie themself.

GAG places a gag over the mouth of the target player, who must first be 
tied up.  This command will also remove a gag.  A player can only remove 
a gag from themself if they are no longer tied up.  It is not possible 
to talk or use any of the channels while gagged.

BLINDFOLD places a blindfold over the eyes of the target player, who must 
first be tied up.  The blindfold can also be removed with this command.  
A player can only remove a blindfold from themself if they are no longer 
tied up.  Unsurprisingly, blindfolded players cannot see.
~

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

0 Shapeshifter Shape Shifter ss~
Shapeshifters are constantly shape changing beings that are magical in
nature.  They have the ability to change form at will and assume the
talents of the creature they chose to shift in to.

To do this the shapeshifter must first seek out a creature and while
standing in front of it they type shift [creature].  After shifting
into that creature the shapeshifter would then type talents and see
what talents and emotions that creature had possessed.  If there were
any unlearned talents on the creature the shapeshifter would see the
talent's name then an equal sign (=) followed by a 0.  The shapeshifter
would then use that talent until the equal sign turned into an astrisk
(*).  All talents can go to 100.      

Being magical beings shapeshifters have the ability to train their
spell levels up to 295 in each color.  Also since being able to change
shape at will, they have become better at using their body attacks. 
These attacks include unarmed, claw, suck, and bite.    

* Shift - Shifts the shape into the form of a mob.
* Talents - Shows any new skills that can be learned from the
            currently shifted-into mob
* Sinduct - Induct a shape into your clan. (Must be Gen 1 or Gen 2)
* Sexpel - Outcasts a shape from your clan. (Must be Gen 1 or Gen 2)

* Entropies - Five elemental stones providing resistance and power against
              certain classes.

Entropy Stones

There are five elemental stones that load throughout the mud called Entropy
stones. They are, essentially, a shapeshifter. They give the power, and the
might needed to be successful in the arts.

Each bread in the realms are weak, and strong against specific elements. If
a demon is weak against cold, strong with fire, then a shapeshifter will
recieve bonus defence for aquiring a fire stone, and bonus defense for
aquiring a ice stone. This is only while fighting the class whos elements
are affecting you.

Once you aquire an entropy stone, all you have to do is hold it in your inventory,
the affects are automatic. However, for each entropy stone you carry, the affects
are lowered. If you are carrying a fire and a ice gem, the bonus to your defence
will be half of what it would be than if you only have one fire gem, same for
the ice. This even applies for if you have all five entropy stones. The affects
will be considerably low, and will not make much of a difference.

Since entropy stones are so rare, there will only be two of them in the mud at
any one time. If one player has two fire gems, and no others, it will be the
same as if he just had one fire gem, as fire is already consuming his whole body,
however if a shapeshifter has two fire, and one ice gem, then he will have
2/3rds of the affect of fire, and 1/3 of the affect of ice.

Entropy stones are found randomly throughout the mud. They may be tough to find,
so being looking now.

The elements are:
    &s&RFire &CIce &BAir &yEarth &gPoison&t

A list of each classes elements are in help entropytable.

This represents the 'danger' of the player.  You only have a status if 
you are level 3.  It grants extra damcap, and is a good measure of

0 STANCE~
Syntax: stance <style>

In combat, the stance of the fighter plays a very important role; you 
can't just stand there and exchange blow for blow unless you are very 
confident of your ability.  Each fighting stance has advantages and 
disadvantages, the basic outline of which follows:
VIPER: A very fast and aggressive style of combat, concentrating on 
striking your opponent before they have the chance to avoid or block you.
CRANE: A wide, sweeping style of combat, which concentrates on a very 
strong blocking defence.
CRAB: A low, defensive fighting stance which uses agile footwork and 
rolling with attacks in order to reduce your injuries.
MONGOOSE: A light-footed stance, which relies on leaps and acrobatics to 
ensure that by the time your opponent makes their attack, you've moved 
out of the way.
BULL: A low aggressive stance which concentrates purely on physical power.

powers and allows them to begin training for a magic specialization..

  * Once you are an archmage you must save up 5 million experience points
    and use the command 'soulbond'.
  * As a sorceror you may tie a grand sorceror for leadership of their
    colour
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The bonus powers granted to a Sorcerer are as follows....
  
  * Stop -- This power allows you to stun your opponent but the potent 
            magic also does a minor amount of damage to the Sorcerer.
  * Planeshift -- This power allows the Sorcerer to walk the planes of 
                  magic to any player given that they have more mana
                  then their victim.
  * Solar Flare -- (Grand Sorcerer Only!) This power allows a Grand 
                   Sorcerer (or Clan Leader) to call upon the power of the
                   sun to strike down their foes-- Note this power also 
                   does considerable damage to the Sorcerer but well worth
                   the price.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(A Sorcerer can also train to become a Necromancer, an Illusionist, or an 
 Invoker.. please see HELP NECRO, HELP ILLUSIONIST, or HELP INVOKER.)

following guidelines for point costs (QP's = Quest Points):

Stats (Str/Dex/Int/Wis/Con): 20 QP's per +1, max allowed is +3 per stat.
Hp/Mana/Move: 5 QP per +1, max allowed is +25 on each.
Hitroll/Damroll: 30 QP's per +1, max allowed is +5 on each.
Ac: 10 QP's per -1, max allowed is -25.

Once a certain affect (str, hitroll, ac, etc) is selected, it cannot be 
chosen again for that item even if you didn't select the maximum allowed 
amount.  Choosing to have penalties on an item will not decrease its 
cost, although some Quest Makers may allow extra points if you select a 
few disadvantages on the item.

For more information, type 'quest'.

0 QUESTCARD COMPLETE RECHARGE~
Syntax: complete card
Syntax: complete card <object>
Syntax: recharge card machine

A quest card requires 4 objects to complete.  To find out what 4 objects 
you need, type 'complete card'.  When you find these items, you should 
type 'complete card <object>'.  Once you have completed all 4 items on 
the card you will be told that you have completed the card.  Then you 
should go and find the dark crypt, where there is a machine, and type 
'recharge card machine'.  You will receive a quest token reward, which 
you should eat, and the card will be recharged with 4 new items to find.

HINT:  Vallandar's tomb can be found by going 2 south, 7 east, 2 north 
from recall.  Once you have found that area, you should look for the 
guardian and solve his riddle, enter the portal he creates, and you'll be 
in the dark crypt.
~

0 QUEST-TYPES~
The following are a few examples of quest types:
* Find the object/s.  Examples: Find 5 different coloured potions, Find a 
  pitch black longsword that flames brightly, Find a dragon dagger, belt 
  and bracer, etc.
* Kill the mob/s.  These can be hunt down and kill, or simple placing the 
  player in the same room as the mob/s.  Can also be combined with finding 
  objects - Example: Find and kill two different dragons and bring me 
  their claws.
* Solve a puzzle.  For example find a certain room, solve a riddle in an 
  area, or successfully get out of a maze.  These are particularly good 
  when several players of different ability are competing in the quest.
* Duel: A one-on-one fight pitting either a player against a mob, or 
  (more usually) a player against another player.  The conditions will be 
  decided beforehand, and can include any conditions that both sides 
  agree on.  Example: No sanctuary, no potions (or maybe a limited number),
  no spells, no weapons, or whatever.
* P-K Quest: Like a duel, but involves several players on either side.  
  Although the sides don't have to be equal in number, it is generally a 
  good idea to make sure they are roughly equal in power.
* There are also several more obscure quests that can be run - for 
  example you could require that the player brings you 3 small green 
  eggs, then load mob 30005 into the players room.  Another battle might 
  involve no melee - all combat must be with missile weapons.

the main features of mages are as follows:

* Extra spells - Extra spells unavailable to non-mages, including spells 
  such as 'find familiar', 'major creation', etc.
* Advanced spells - Available to the more powerful of mages, this ability 
  allows the mage to create their own spells from scratch.  Such a task is 
  very difficult as well as time consuming, however.
* Ceremony - Allows the mage to gain mana back through ancient ceremony.
* Teach - Allows the mage to make an apprentice.

Certain commands (PASSWORD) are protected against LOG.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

LOG ALL logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots.

SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.

character at a time.

11 HUNTERS~
Hunters are the people of the world who use their entire lives in        
searching and eliminating out all of the evil and supernatural beings    
that prevent humananity from surviving. Most of the beings think they    
are regular humans, but when they are faced by a fully-trained Hunter,   
the Hunter proves them completely wrong. As the hunter gets stronger,    
powers against the evil are granted to them by the Heralds of the        
Heavens. These powers are called Edges. With these edges, hunters will   
have it easier to throw out all of humanity's enemies around them, and   
leave humanity in serenity. Humans are not left with just Edges and      
without a weapon, the Heralds of the Heaven have granted strong Hunters  
the gunblade, a weapon that has malicious affects versus the enemies of  
the Hunter. As you might think that being one of the imbued is very      
simple as to just getting the Edges and gunblade. But, the mastering of  
being a hunter takes decades to accomplish with the almost impossible    
training. Most of the hunters that are in training either drop out from  
the stress and find another occupation less severe or don't even survive 
it. Beware, those who have mastered shall NOT in any way help you with   
your training, due to the Heralds of the Heavens getting angry. This is  
because they do not want a weak hunter on their hands, needing help to   
do everything, and give a bad name to Hunters. Hunters may also join a   
Sect of Hunters to group on the evil instead of fighting it solo.

* Hunttalk   - Channel for Hunters to boast of their hunting accomplishments.

0 'GHOST TOWN'~
This is purely a simple hack-n-slash area with the interesting added feature
that you can't recall... You have to fight your way through the many powerful
high level undead that populate this place. To a good mudder its heaven. To
someone who flees when fighting the children in Mud School, its probably gonna
be considered impossible. Either way, have fun.

0 FRENZY~
Syntax: cast 'frenzy' <character>

This spell causes the target to enter a berserk fighting rage, improving 
their damage and chances to hit, but also making them easier to be hit. 
~

0 FORTITUDE~
This is the ability of a vampire to resist damage.  As the skill increases so does a vampires innate armor class.
~

6 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command.

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~

0 FOLLOW GROUP~
Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
~

0 FLY~
Syntax: cast 'fly' <character>

This spell enables the target character to fly.
~

0 FLEE RESCUE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 FLAMESTRIKE~

This spell inflicts damage on the victim.
~

~

0 FIGHT STYLE FIGHTSTYLE~
Syntax: fightstyle <number> <style>

This is used for unarmed combat, and it allows the fighter to decide on 
their style of unarmed attack.  Many different types of attack are 
possible, each with different advantages and disadvantages.  Your first 
attack in combat always uses the first number slot.  If you have a second 
attack, this will draw a fighting technique from slots 1 to 4.  If you 
have a third attack, it will draw a fighting technique from slots 5 to 
8.  Any other attacks are randomly drawn from any of slots 1 to 8.  If 
the slot is blank (0) then the attack is a standard unarmed attack.
~

0 FAVOUR SIRE PRINCE~
Syntax: favour <target> <sire/prince>

Favour is an ability available to second generation vampires and vampire 
princes.

SIRE allows the target vampire of your clan to sire another vampire.  
Once a single vampire has been created the power is lost, but can be 
granted again if the Antediluvian or Prince so desire.  A childe sired 
without permission is known as an Anarch.

PRINCE turns the target vampire into a prince, who is then able to allow 
other vampires the ability to sire more vampires still.  Only an 
Antediluvian has the power to make some a prince (or to remove the 
prince's powers).

ACCEPT will accept a childe into the clan, making them a Neonate.

INDUCT and OUTCAST will accept an Anarch into the clan or outcast a member.
~

0 FASTDRAW~
FASTDRAW is automatic, if you have it.  If another player attacks you 
while you have any sheathed weapons, you will draw them out with

blows on you.  If you have any items in your hands at the time, you will 
throw them aside before drawing your weapons.
~

0 'FAERIE FOG'~

the same room as you.
~

0 'FAERIE FIRE'~

~

0 EXPERIENCE XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.

You gain experience by being part of a group that kills someone/something.

You lose experience by dying or being decapitated.

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your alignment versus your opponent's alignment; how 
many of this monster have been killed lately (if they are an NPC); and 
some random variation.

0 DEMON DEMONS CHAMPION CHAMPIONS~
These fiends are the damned ones.  They have sold their souls in exchange 
for power, and they improve this power by draining the souls of their 
victims.  Their powers are mysterious, but the following facts are known:

* Each Champion, Demon, or Demon Prince follows a specific Demon Lord.  
  They are able to channel the souls of their victims to their Demon Lord, 
  who in turn can use that power to grant favours to his/her followers.
* Demonic armour improves the combat ability of the wearer, the more 
  armour worn the better the improvement.
* Many demons are able to transport themselves to each other at will.
* Most demons are able to assume the form of a weapon.
* The demons power over death is such that even after they have been 
  decapitated, they are still able to employ a selection of powers.
* The powers of a specific demon vary considerably.  Some are barely more 
  powerful than a common avatar, while others are as strong as the greatest 
  of werewolves or vampires.
* While in hell, a demon is virtually unkillable.

0 DECAPITATE DECAP TEAR~
Do this to another avatar when they are mortally wounded, and you will 
suck out some of their lifeforce (represented by 1000exp), making them 
mortal again.  You may also loot their corpse, of course, and if you are 
hungry you can even eat their head ;)
Decapitation alone is not enough to completely destroy another avatar 
however, for their head will retain their remaining lifeforce.  To truely 
kill them, you must crack open their head and eat (or in some other way 
destroy) their brain.

0 DEATH~

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is half of your 
current amount, so it's a good idea not to hoard exp.

~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your magical ability increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.

Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

0 BEAST GOLCONDA FRENZY~
When a vampire's beast rating reaches 0 they are considered to have reached Golconda.  These vampires receive the 
benefits of very low blood costs for vampire abilities, higher parry/dodge, resistance to fire, and the ability to calm 
and use daywalker.  Once Golconda has been reached the song of SERENITY learned through the Animalism discipline may be 
used to calm a vampire of his rage, there allowing him regenerate quickly.  Daywalker allows him to travel by day and 
be unaffected by sunlight.  One reaches Golconda immediately (here) and only through divine intervention may they 
become Beast Vampires.
Beast vampires receive a frenzy bonus much higher than that of a normal vampire.  They pay for this with incredible 
blood upkeeps, and through they're lack of resistance to sunlight and fire.  A vampire raises his beast by starving 
himself and berserking on innocents, although once a Vampire reaches Golconda he cannot turn towards the beast.
Frenzy is also linked to Beast.  The higher your beast the more you frenzy benefits you.  Also while in a frenzy a 
vampire can regenerate lost body parts and slowly heal, although regenerating is a much faster way.

0 BACKSTAB BERSERK BS DISARM KICK PUNCH KILL~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: berserk
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: punch    <character>
Syntax: kill     <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

BERSERK will make you strike out at every creature in the room.  It will 
hit players as well as mobiles, so it's a good idea not to use this skill 
while you are grouped.
DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.
PUNCH will inflict a small amount of damage, and stun your opponent for a 
short period of time.  It also has a chance of breaking your opponents 
nose or jaw.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, KICK or PUNCH successfully, you must practice
the appropriate skill.

0 AUCTION CHAT . MUSIC ANSWER SHOUT YELL~

Syntax: chat     <message>
Syntax: music    <message>
Syntax: question <message>
Syntax: answer   <message>
Syntax: shout    <message>
Syntax: yell     <message>

These commands send messages through communication channels to other players.

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

AUCTION, CHAT, MUSIC, and QUESTION and ANSWER also send messages to all
interested players.  '.' is a synonym for CHAT.  The QUESTION and ANSWER
commands both use the same 'question' channel

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

You can use the CHANNELS command to hear, or not hear, any of these channels.
~

5 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

AT executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given

AT works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).

0 AMAZONSLAVE~
Amazon Slaves are what have become a submissive order of men who,
for one reason or another, have ended up under the strick control
of the Amazon Women. Amazon Slaves are taught and trained in the
exact same style of combat as the Amazon Women. They in time also
begin to worship Artemis and as with the Amazon Women, Artemis
lends the slaves his blessing to aid them in combat. A Slave is
trained from the beginning to listen and obey the commands of
any and all Amazon Women, and do so or strick punishment will
be delt. An Amazon Slave can easily rival the strength of even the
best Amazon Woman, but only with obedience and the will to do so.

Amazon Slaves train the exact same powers as the Women, use the
#1help amazon#n file as reference.

The only unique skill to the Amazon Slave is their travel command
which is listed below.

* Amazonworship - Travel command for Amazon Slaves.

~

0 AMAZON AMAZONS~
Purely a female class, the Amazons stand as a powerful group. Under
the protection of Artemis, Amazons show no fear when charging into
battle. Men serve little purpose to Amazons other than for reproduction
and/or as slaves forced to serve their lives under the whim of their
Amazon master. Amazons can call upon their god in times of battle to
help aid them in destroying those who wish to challenge the power
of these women warriors.

* Sisters  - Shows info in other Amazons currently logged on.
* Genesis  - Amazon armour creation.
* Amaztalk - Amazon channel.
* Combo    - Use to train combo skills. (type combo power improve)
* Drill    - Use to buy special powers. (type drill power improve)

8 ALLOW BAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
Syntax: ban     <site>
Syntax: ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list.

The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

Site bans are not saved; every time the server is rebooted, the site
ban list is cleared.

0 ADVANCEDSTANCE~
Syntax: combat <style>

Advanced stances can be learned after you have become a grand master in 
two normal stances.  These stances are much better than the others.
MANTIS: Requires CRANE and VIPER before it can be learned.  This stance 
combines a very strong defence with lightning fast counter attacks.
DRAGON: Requires BULL and CRAB before it can be learned.  This stance 
uses very powerful attacks, as well as protecting the fighter from injury.
TIGER: Requires BULL and VIPER before it can be learned.  Probably the 
most aggressive of all the stances, this style utilizes very powerful and
lightning fast attacks.
MONKEY: Requires CRANE and MONGOOSE before it can be learned.  The only 
affect of this stance is to completely nullify the advantages of your 
opponents stance.
SWALLOW: Requires MONGOOSE and CRAB before it can be learned.  This is 
the most defensive of all the stances, combining agile dodges with the 
ability to 'roll' with an attack, helping prevent injury.

&wDruids are a class that despise civilization.  They have formed a bond
with nature, giving them the ability to call upon animals and trees to 
do their bidding.  Over the years, Druids have become so in tune with 
nature, that the trees actually respond to their call.  Druids hate 
using anything that isnt natural, and fight significantly better with 
an oak staff than with a sword.


Druids have attained the following powers/spells through
their bond with nature:  

DRAGON BREATH - Spell that increases damage, spell resistance, and 
damage cap
ANGEL BREATH - Spell that increases hitting ability and spell 
resistance
PHOENIX SIGHT - Allows the Druid to see everything within the shadows
SHILLELAGH - A beautiful wooden staff that makes a supreme weapon
REWARD - Powers granted to the Druid from nature
REDEEM - Spell to remove natural hinderances
BERRY - Druids can create berries to heal themselves, among other 
things..

A druid ADEPT may promote, demote, induct or outcast people inside his or her
  clan through the command 'naturalize'
A druid TEACHER may induct out outcast people inside his or her clan through
the command 'naturalize'

&YSince druids are allied with forests, it is there nature to 'sit' in the
forests to relax and regain their health.  Also Druids get an extra weapon type.
Thwack is damage done by their oaken staves created by the Shillelagh spell

With extensive studying the ninjas were able to learn the art of Mantra.  They took that knowledge and became known as Mystic Samurai.

-Arcane Knight (Druid + Vampire)
Understood by only a few, Arcane knights have chosen a life of living dead.  Druids have given up their souls to vampires in order to protect nature.  Time is no longer essential to druids for they have eternity to defend what they hold sacred.  With their ancient wooden staffs they are able to destroy any opposition with ease.  Their only weakness is their extreme lust for blood.  Plagued by this insatiable thirst for blood, Arcane knights must sustain a certain amount of blood in order to function. Arcane knights only have begun to conceive what inherent powers they possess.

Throughout history, their brothers and sisters have fought with fang, claw and spirit to protect Gaia -the Earth Mother.  By evolving into Gaou, werewolves have entered their final stages of complete control of their rage.  They are able to shapeshift into their main predators, humans, whom have plagued this world to kingdom come.

-Sith Lord  (Jedi + Golem)

Hybirds are a combination of two classes. They are available once you
reach tier three, and you must declass before you can become one.

As a hybrid, you will have most if not all of both of the classes skills,
except some of them will be weaker. The original classes will still be
available ('pure' classes), and the skills will be more powerful as a pure
class than as a hybrid.

Watch out what you ask for.

On my first godwar mud (the first that I understood, at least), from before more than monks
had travel skills, and it took days to get to 10k hp, a week to max a class, the owner had
gotten tired of everyone always asking for a travel skill for their class, or for the ability
to ..... or readaura, or scry AND hunt... so this is what he did:

Read the rest of the helpfile before you read the helpfile "plato"
Whenever you tried to use a class power, it would say what's in the helpfile named "plato"

Whenever you try to use a spell that helps one class more than another,
it would say what it says in the helpfile named "plato"

Whenever you had a round of fight with another player, or mob, it would:
1. set your class to 0, and then after the round set it back (you would lose nothing),
   just that you fight as a mortal when this happens...
2. say what it says in the helpfile named "plato"

I hope this enlightens you,
btw, if you saw what it says in help plato, that means the skill/spell had no affect.

YOU ARE RIGHT! ALL CLASSES SHOULD BE THE SAME!

p.s. if you don't know what this means, read help watchout

0 Abort~
Abort mode will be displayed on who if the mud is in it. It means the following:
On the next crash, the mud will call abort() instead of using the normal copyover
on crash code. This means that the mud will disconnect everyone, and to make sure
that it does get to the abort() statement, it will not send any messages. The following
is what abort() does:

It creates a file called a Core Dump, which is basically an exact copy of the mud
when it crashed. It allows you to load the core dump in to the debugger as if you
were in the debugger at the exact time of the crash. This helps me find bugs, and
will overall make the mud much more stable. When the mud pops back up after a crash
in abort mode, abort mode will no longer be set.
