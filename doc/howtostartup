make sure you read the file MRstart, this file is outdated and doesn't contain
some neccassary stuff you will need to know that is unique to Midnight Realities 2.5
Still, you will need to do the stuff that is in here.

make a directory in the directory this is found in, called player
inside the player directory make 2 directories, one called backup and one
called store. The store directory contains the backup pfiles, and the
backup directory contains finger files. If a player file gets bugged,
which they do a lot, go into the backup directory and cp Pfile ..
the backups are from the last time the player typed save, and when pfiles
get bugged the player usually looses all their equipment, so this is the
best way to reimburse.

you will need to compile the mud, so go to the src directory and type make
and then type: ./startup (port number)&  where 'port number' is the port
you want to start the mud on, and the & means run it in the background.

anyways that should be all you need to do to start the mud up. Have fun
and read the license part (at least the one smoo(me) wrote, bryantos got a
bit drunk when he wrote his part)
