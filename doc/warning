BE CAREFUL! THis mud doesn't crash...it's very very stable...ahhhhhhh! Err yeah,
well basically doesn't crash..I've had a few problems but I fix them almost
immediately..I've gone to 54 hours a couple weeks ago, and another mud running
this code is at 56 hours right now..they haven't crashed since they started it
up.. Have fun!


DO NOT REMOVE THE HLOOK FILE. That is what the mud uses to look up host names.
If you do it the normal way, it lags the mud for some hosts...


..right at the time I'm releasing it's back at 54 hours exactly, and the few crashes
before it were caused by imms screwing around.. Yay. Heh, don't use superset, you WILL
crash the mud..it directly edits memory. Look at the code, if you understand what it is
saying, you have a chance of being able to use it..
