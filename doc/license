The following restrictions are placed on the use of this source code, if you are using any of the original
classes that this code was released with.

Issue
I. You may not claim work that you have not done as your own, and may not remove or refuse a comment before
a block of code to anybody that asks for their code to be recognized in this way.

II. You will respect all licenses that are attached to the release that you have downloaded, and follow them
as if they are law, even if they are not legally binding. This is making them legally binding.

III. You must keep the version command readable by all players, and you may not remove or edit the output of 
the command unless you are the original other, or the only change is to add your own credits. Credits for 
Godwars, LOW, Rogue Edition, Midnight Dreams, and Midnight Realities must remain attached to this command.

IV. The help files 'merc' and 'diku' must remain readable by all players.
